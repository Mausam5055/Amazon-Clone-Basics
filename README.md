# 🛒 Amazon Clone Webpage

A clone of Amazon's homepage created as part of my **Full Stack Developer journey** at **Apna College (Delta Batch)**. This project helped me understand the core principles of web development, responsive layouts, and user interface design.

## 📚 Learning Journey

Building this project was both **challenging and rewarding**. I ran into several roadblocks while working on layout structuring and responsiveness, but overcame them by:
- Watching YouTube tutorials  
- Practicing consistently  
- Applying concepts learned in the course  

A huge thank you to **Shraddha Khapra ma’am**, whose **exceptional teaching** made everything simpler and more enjoyable to learn!
